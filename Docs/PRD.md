Perfect — yes, we absolutely need a PRD (Product Requirements Document) now.
Since you’re at the 0 → 1 + investor-ready stage, we’ll build a founder-grade PRD that aligns with:
	•	your hybrid architecture (Stablecoin + Polygon + Solana + PSPs + Banks)
	•	your emotional African brand story
	•	and a clear MVP scope for pre-seed investment.

🚀 PRD: Relyr (Cross-Border Finance Infrastructure for Africa & the World)

Version: v1.0
Author: Founding Team
Date: November 2025

⸻

1. Vision

To make money move as fast as trust — empowering Africans and global businesses to send, receive, and grow money beyond borders and barriers, in minutes, not days.

⸻

2. Mission

Bridge traditional finance and blockchain rails to power instant, compliant, and borderless payments for Africans working, trading, and building globally — whether they use a bank or stablecoin.

⸻

3. Core Problem

Africans lose time, trust, and value when money crosses borders:
	•	Payments take days via banks or SWIFT.
	•	Hidden FX costs erode income.
	•	Blocked access for freelancers, startups, or diaspora families.
	•	Low trust in fintechs using crypto rails.

⸻

4. Proposed Solution

Relyr is a hybrid payment platform that:
	•	Connects global fiat networks (PSPs, banks, card rails)
	•	With instant blockchain rails (Polygon, Solana, USDC/USDT)
	•	Through one unified wallet and API layer.

💡 Think of it as “Flutterwave + Circle + Wise” for Africa —
built for instant money movement, trade, and earnings.
